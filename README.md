Regis Quadroupled Robot

This project started out as a desire to bring something along the lines of a droid from Star Wars to life.
I could see that the technology existed, but there seemed to only be a few entities making any real progress.
This is why I created Regis, with the hope of disseminating uniquely trainable copies of AI everywhere. 
I believe that the decentralization of AI and its distribution to the public is an important step in an agreeable humanity.

That being said this type of project will never be finished.

Regis is a basic chassis, power source, and two axis head designed loosely around a spider (although 4 legged).
